#Small script to rename and collect all memes into a superfile.
# The scraper will put memes into unique folders with 100 pictures each. For ease of use this script just gives all of those images unique identifiers and collects
# them into one file. This functionality will later be implemented directly into the parser, after which this script will be deprecated
